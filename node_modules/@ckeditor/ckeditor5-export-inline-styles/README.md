=====================================

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ckeditor%2Fckeditor5-export-inline-styles.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-export-inline-styles)

This package contains an Export with Inline Styles feature for CKEditor&nbsp;5. It allows you to export editor content with all formatting preserved as inline styles, making it easier to use in environments where external style sheets are unavailable.
